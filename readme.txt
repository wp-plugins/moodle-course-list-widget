== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to display a list of Moodle courses for a specific user of Moodle. This is ideal for teachers who use WordPress for public communication and Moodle for private classroom activities. This widget will allow the teacher to display a list of their courses so that parents and students can quickly navigate between WordPress and Moodle.

This plugin is designed for use in larger institutions and must be configured by a web administrator. There are 3 places in the code where you must make changes to get this plugin working properly.

IMPORTANT:  You will need to edit the code of this plugin in 3 places in order for this to work properly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version of Moodle and Wordpress is required? =

This plugin has been tested and approved for Moodle version 2.4 and Wordpress 3.5.   I am pretty sure it will work with any version of Wordpress 3+.

= I get a MySQL connection error. =

You have not properly edited the plugin code.  You must provide a connection to your Moodle database.  This should be a READ ONLY user account.

= I edited the code and still get an error. =

Most likely your database connection settings are incorrect.  Please recheck and verify you can connect using the user and password for MySQL.
